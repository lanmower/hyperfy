# .prd - Krunker-Style TPS Game: Full Netcode & Physics Stack

## GOAL
Build a playable TPS game on schwust.glb map with complete netcode, physics, and game patterns. No graphics - pure physics/networking validation via CLI. Players spawn, move, shoot, respawn with full lag compensation and replay system.

## PHASE B: INFRASTRUCTURE (Reliability & Validation)

---

## PHASE D: FULL GAME INTEGRATION (TPS on Schwust)

### D3: Combat Validation
- [ ] Test shooting, hit detection, respawn flow
  - Scenario: 2 players, player A shoots player B
  - Verify: B takes damage, dies, respawns
  - Test: multiple shots, lag compensation accuracy
  - Test: respawn timer visible to client
  - Blocks: D4

### D4: Multi-Client Game Session
- [ ] Full integration test with 10 clients
  - Scenario: 10 players on schwust.glb, FFA deathmatch
  - Duration: 5 minute match
  - Measure: server stability, bandwidth, accuracy
  - Verify: all players can move, shoot, respawn
  - Test: scoring works, leaderboard updates
  - Verify: replay recording captures match
  - Blocks: D5

### D5: Stress Test Validation
- [ ] Run stress test suite on live game
  - Add 100 physics objects to map
  - Run game with 10 clients + 100 objects
  - Measure: tick time, bandwidth, accuracy
  - Verify: 128 TPS maintained
  - Target: < 50ms latency, < 20 KB/s per player
  - Blocks: (final validation)

### Code Quality
- ✓ All files under 200 lines
- ✓ No duplicate code
- ✓ No comments (self-documenting)
- ✓ No mocks/fakes (real physics, real networking)
- ✓ Ground truth only

### Testing & Validation
- ✓ All game patterns tested with real physics
- ✓ 10-client session stress tested
- ✓ Replay system validates data integrity
- ✓ Witnessed execution of full 5-minute game
- ✓ Performance metrics captured and verified
