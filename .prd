# Spawnpoint Playwriter Fix - PRD

## Phase 2: Server Startup & Static Files (COMPLETE)
Server starts on port 3000, all 8 static routes tested and passing:
- Route / serves client/index.html (316 bytes, text/html)
- Route /app.js serves client/app.js (1287 bytes, text/javascript)
- Route /style.css serves client/style.css (271 bytes, text/css)
- Route /src/index.js serves SDK barrel (938 bytes, text/javascript)
- Route /src/sdk/server.js serves server SDK (8789 bytes, text/javascript)
- Route /src/physics/World.js serves physics (7381 bytes, text/javascript)
- Route /world/schwust.glb serves environment mesh (4168324 bytes, model/gltf-binary)
- Route /world/kaira.glb serves character model (13616 bytes, model/gltf-binary)
All HTTP responses: 200 OK with correct Content-Type headers
Server log output: "[server] http://localhost:3000 @ 128 TPS"

## Phase 3: Client Initialization (COMPLETE)
Client initialization fully tested and verified with debug hooks:
- Canvas element #game verified in DOM when app.js runs
- PhysicsNetworkClient imports and loads without errors
- WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:3000/ws succeeds
- Console error handlers properly configured
- Render function executes with canvas drawing and state display
- Debug hooks added: window.gameState and window.debug with getConnectedPlayers(), getCanvasSize(), isConnected(), getServerUrl()
- Server output: [server] http://localhost:3000 @ 128 TPS
- WebSocket connection test: [+] player 1 connection event confirmed

## Phase 4: Network & Physics (Blocks on Phase 3)
- [ ] Verify server accepts WebSocket connections
- [ ] Verify player join events fire
- [ ] Verify server sends initial world state
- [ ] Verify client receives snapshot messages
- [ ] Verify render updates with network state
- [ ] Test basic entity rendering

## Phase 5: Playwriter Integration (Blocks on Phase 4)
- [ ] Create playwriter test script that launches game
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Wait for game canvas to appear
- [ ] Verify canvas renders content
- [ ] Capture screenshot of running game
- [ ] Verify no console errors in playwriter

## Phase 6: Cleanup & Verification (Blocks on Phase 5)
- [ ] Remove any temporary debug files
- [ ] Verify all modules hot-reload compatible
- [ ] Verify recovery paths exist
- [ ] Test full game loop: start → connect → render → stop
- [ ] Verify system doesn't crash on any error path
