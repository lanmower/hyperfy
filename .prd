## Player Physics - CharacterVirtual Migration

- [ ] Verify slope handling in live game - player walks up ramps without launching
- [ ] Verify stair stepping works in live game
- [ ] Verify floor sticking on downslopes in live game
- [ ] Verify jump still works correctly in live game
- [ ] Verify hot-reload preserves player CharacterVirtual state in live game

## WebTransport Integration

- [ ] Install @fails-components/webtransport
- [ ] Add WebTransport server alongside existing WebSocket server
- [ ] Classify 28 message types as reliable (stream) vs unreliable (datagram)
- [ ] Abstract ConnectionManager transport layer to support both WebSocket and WebTransport
- [ ] Client auto-detects WebTransport support and falls back to WebSocket
- [ ] Verify snapshots sent as unreliable datagrams
- [ ] Verify control messages sent as reliable streams
- [ ] Verify dual-protocol works simultaneously

## Hot Reload Improvements

- [ ] Replace Object.assign reload pattern with prototype-chain-aware swap
- [ ] Add reload lock that pauses tick during swap
- [ ] Add message queue during reload window
- [ ] Add pre-reload module shape validation
- [ ] Add rollback on failed reload
- [ ] Reduce debounce from 500ms to 100ms
- [ ] Auto-reset failure counter on successful reload

## App DX Improvements

- [ ] Wire onCollision callback - AppRuntime.fireCollision exists but nothing invokes it
- [ ] Make box/sphere/capsule colliders create actual Jolt bodies (currently only trimesh does)
- [ ] Add app config/options from world definition entities
- [ ] Add ctx.time.after(seconds, fn) and ctx.time.every(seconds, fn) with auto-cleanup
- [ ] Add math utilities (vec3, quat helpers)
- [ ] Add ctx.entity.lookAt, ctx.entity.distanceTo
- [ ] Auto-trimesh convention - entity with model and no app gets static trimesh
