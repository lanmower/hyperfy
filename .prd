## APP STARTUP FIX & FOLDER-BASED REFACTORING


### WAVE 3: Validate & Test (After WAVE 2 complete)

#### App Loading Validation
- [x] Start server and verify all apps load from folder structure
- [x] Confirm AppLoader discovers apps/app-name/index.js pattern
- [x] Verify no errors in app loading console output
- [x] Test hot-reload by modifying an app file
- Blocks: WAVE 4

#### Full Integration Testing
- [x] Start server from cold boot
- [x] Verify WebSocket accepts client connections
- [x] Test world initialization with all entities
- [x] Verify physics world loads environment colliders
- [x] Test player spawn at world spawnPoint
- [x] Verify tick system runs at 128 TPS
- [x] Connect test client and receive snapshots
- [x] Test app interactions (doors, NPCs, crates, game loop)
- [x] Verify no crashes during 30-second run
- Blocks: WAVE 4

### WAVE 4: Cleanup (After WAVE 3 complete)

#### Final Cleanup
- [x] Verify world/ directory still contains shared assets
- [x] Confirm apps/ contains only app-name/ folders (no loose .js files)
- [x] Delete any orphaned files
- [x] Run final cold-boot startup test
- [x] Verify all features work end-to-end
